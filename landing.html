								<h3>UNIT 1</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In the first week of the module, I was introduced to the fundamentals of cloud computing, which laid the foundation for the rest of the course.  
								The evolution of cloud technologies was explained together with the three main service models: 
								Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).  
								Real-world examples from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud helped me understand how these models are applied in practice and why organizations choose different approaches depending on their strategies.
								The advantages of scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency were contrasted with challenges such as vendor lock-in, security issues, and compliance requirements.  
								This showed me that cloud adoption is not only a technical decision but also a business and governance matter.
								</p>
								<p>
								Before this unit, I only had a general idea of cloud services. Now, I clearly understand how IaaS provides infrastructure flexibility, PaaS accelerates application development, and SaaS delivers ready-to-use solutions.  
								Reviewing official definitions like NIST SP 800-145 and examples from AWS and Azure gave me a solid and standardised base.  
								This knowledge has prepared me to engage with advanced topics such as automation, hybrid cloud, and security in the following units.

								<h3>UNIT 2</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this unit, I was introduced to the principles of cloud architecture and the frameworks that support its design, deployment, and maintenance.  
								We examined TOGAF, which provides a structured approach to aligning cloud systems with business needs, and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which ensures systematic and iterative development.  
								Another key focus was Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which automates infrastructure provisioning through declarative scripts, reducing human error and increasing consistency.
								</p>
								<p>
								What I found most valuable was the realisation that cloud architecture is not only technical but also strategic.  
								TOGAF highlighted the importance of aligning IT systems with organisational goals, while SDLC reinforced the value of process and governance in building sustainable solutions.  
								IaC stood out as particularly transformative, showing how automation enables rapid deployment while ensuring compliance.  
								Reviewing examples such as ARM templates and Terraform scripts demonstrated how these frameworks and tools converge in practice, creating scalable, efficient, and well-governed cloud environments.
								</p>
								<p>
								This unit helped me understand that successful cloud solutions rely not only on technology but also on disciplined frameworks and structured methodologies.

								<h3>UNIT 3</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit highlighted the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into cloud computing, showing how AI-driven technologies improve automation, optimisation, and overall performance in cloud environments.  
								Through topics such as machine learning (ML), data analytics, and AI applications in security, data lifecycle management, and infrastructure monitoring, I learned how these capabilities enhance scalability and reliability.
								</p>
								<p>
								I found this unit particularly insightful because it shifted my view of AI from being a supplementary feature to a core enabler of intelligent cloud systems.  
								AI-powered automation minimises human involvement in repetitive tasks, optimises resource allocation, and strengthens cybersecurity by detecting threats faster than manual monitoring.  
								Real-world examples, such as predictive scaling in AWS or Google Cloud’s AI-based monitoring, illustrated how organisations reduce costs and improve system efficiency by embedding AI into their operations.
								</p>
								<p>
								Practical case studies further reinforced these lessons. Azure AI’s integration with Kubernetes demonstrated how AI can optimise container orchestration, while Google Cloud’s AutoML showed how machine learning can be simplified and deployed at scale.  
								These examples confirmed that AI is now central to automation, resilience, and efficiency in cloud-native applications.  
								The knowledge gained from this unit is directly relevant to professional practice, as future cloud systems will increasingly be expected to self-optimise and adapt to evolving demands.

								<h3>UNIT 4</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit introduced practical tools for designing, managing, and automating cloud environments, focusing on scripting languages like Python and Bash, GUI-based management interfaces, and OpenStack as a platform for provisioning infrastructure.  
								I learned how scripting enables automation by reducing manual work, enforcing consistency, and improving scalability, while GUIs provide accessibility and clarity for oversight.  
								What stood out most was the versatility of OpenStack, which showed how organisations can build private or hybrid cloud environments with the flexibility of public platforms.
								</p>
								<p>
								Through practical exercises, I experimented with simple Bash scripts to automate resource creation and reviewed OpenStack commands and dashboards.  
								These activities reinforced the principle that automation through scripting is fundamental to cloud-native practices, while GUI tools complement them by simplifying management.  
								Overall, this unit helped me connect theoretical frameworks with real-world tools, strengthening my confidence in applying automation and orchestration within cloud operations.

								<h3>UNIT 5</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit highlighted how cloud-native technologies support the development of scalable and resilient applications through the 12-Factor App methodology and Kubernetes.  
								The 12-Factor principles, such as environment-based configuration, stateless processes, and disposability, provide a clear framework for designing SaaS applications that are flexible and adaptable.  
								Kubernetes complements this methodology by orchestrating containers, ensuring that deployment, scaling, and self-healing processes are automated and reliable.
								</p>
								<p>
								I found this unit especially valuable because it connected software design principles with real-world deployment practices.  
								It became clear that cloud-native development is not just about coding but about applying disciplined approaches that ensure long-term maintainability and agility.  
								Practical exercises, including deploying a 12-Factor App on Kubernetes with Minikube, using ConfigMaps for environment variables, and scaling applications via kubectl, demonstrated how theory translates into practice.
								</p>
								<p>
								Overall, the combination of the 12-Factor methodology and Kubernetes gave me a deeper understanding of how to build portable, production-ready cloud applications.  
								This knowledge reinforced the importance of both design discipline and orchestration tools in enabling applications to scale effectively in dynamic environments.

								<h3>UNIT 6</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit deepened my understanding of hybrid cloud environments and their growing importance in enterprise IT. 
								Hybrid strategies combine the scalability of public cloud with the control of private infrastructure, offering organizations a balanced approach to performance, cost, and compliance. 
								I also explored Fog and Edge Computing, both of which extend cloud processing closer to devices and sensors. 
								These technologies are vital for latency-sensitive applications such as IoT, autonomous systems, and real-time analytics.
								</p>
								<p>
								A key insight was the challenge of vendor lock-in. I previously saw cloud adoption as mainly a technical performance decision, but now I understand that reliance on a single provider also creates strategic risks. 
								This makes multi-cloud strategies, containerization, and open standards like Kubernetes essential for long-term flexibility.
								</p>
								<p>
								In practice, I studied AWS Outposts and Azure Arc as examples of hybrid extensions, and explored AWS Greengrass and Azure IoT Edge for edge-level data processing. 
								I also examined Kubernetes as a solution for avoiding vendor dependency, ensuring portability across providers. 
								These tools and approaches show how hybrid cloud solutions are not just technical architectures but strategic enablers of resilience and adaptability in the digital era.

								<h3>UNIT 7</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit highlighted the critical role of security and compliance in cloud computing, showing how technical safeguards and regulatory frameworks must work together to protect digital infrastructures. 
								I learned that cloud environments face a wide range of threats, from data breaches and insider misuse to insecure APIs, which require a layered defense strategy. 
								Best practices such as encryption, identity and access management, multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring provide essential protection against these risks (Hashizume et al., 2013).
								</p>
								<p>
								Equally important is compliance with global standards. ISO/IEC 27001 offers a structured approach to information security management, while GDPR ensures the protection of personal data across the EU. 
								I found it particularly insightful that these frameworks not only fulfil legal obligations but also strengthen customer trust and accountability within organizations (Fernandes et al., 2014).
								</p>
								<p>
								Through practical exercises, I explored tools like OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning and AWS IAM for enforcing least-privilege access, as well as Azure Policy dashboards for aligning infrastructure with compliance requirements. 
								These tools illustrated how security and compliance are not separate efforts but complementary components of modern cloud governance.
								</p>
								<p>
								This unit shifted my perspective from viewing cloud security as a narrow technical task to understanding it as a holistic, strategic process. 
								Security must be embedded into architecture, policies, and operations, while compliance provides the framework to ensure accountability and resilience. 
								This knowledge prepares me to design cloud systems that meet both technical and regulatory demands, which is especially crucial in industries like finance, healthcare, and government.

								<h3>UNIT 8</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit highlighted the importance of Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC) in cloud environments. 
								I learned that DR restores systems after outages, while BC ensures ongoing critical operations (Wallace &amp; Webber, 2017). 
								Cloud services like AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery and Azure Site Recovery reduce recovery time and data loss by replicating workloads across regions (Alhazmi &amp; Malaiya, 2013).
								</p>
								<p>
								A key insight was that DR is more than backups—it requires planning, prioritization, and regular testing. 
								Critical applications may need near-zero downtime, while others can tolerate delays, balancing resilience with cost.
								</p>
								<p>
								In practice, I reviewed Azure Site Recovery’s failover features and AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery’s near real-time replication. 
								I also noted how tabletop exercises and live tests validate plans, showing that testing is as vital as preparation.
								</p>
								<p>
								This unit strengthened my ability to design DR plans that combine technical redundancy with business preparedness, ensuring continuity during disruptions.

								<h3>UNIT 9</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit deepened my understanding of cloud migration and integration strategies, showing that moving legacy systems to the cloud is not just a technical exercise but a strategic process involving risk management, downtime minimization, and interoperability (Marston et al., 2011). 
								I learned how organizations often use phased approaches—lift-and-shift, re-platforming, or refactoring—to balance modernization with business continuity. 
								Tools like AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) and Azure Migrate automate replication, schema conversion, and synchronization, which greatly reduce disruption during transitions (Amazon Web Services, 2023; Microsoft, 2023).
								</p>
								<p>
								I previously thought migration was simply about transferring data, but I now see that it requires strong planning, stakeholder involvement, and integration to prevent inefficiencies. 
								The emphasis on hybrid integration—keeping legacy systems running smoothly alongside cloud services—was particularly important. 
								I also became more aware of the risks of vendor lock-in and the value of using tools and architectures that support multi-cloud interoperability.
								</p>
								<p>
								Through practical exploration, I reviewed how AWS DMS migrates databases like Oracle or MySQL while maintaining continuous replication, and how Azure Migrate helps assess and transition workloads with cost insights. 
								Case studies reinforced that phased migrations and pilot testing achieve smoother results compared to “big bang” approaches. 
								These insights helped me appreciate that effective migration strategies are as much about ensuring operational continuity and user experience as they are about technology.

								<h3>UNIT 10 TASK</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit examined serverless computing, a paradigm that abstracts infrastructure management and allows developers to focus solely on code execution while the cloud provider manages scaling and availability (Baldini et al., 2017). 
								Key technologies included AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, both enabling event-driven execution of functions with pay-per-use pricing, which reduces idle resource costs. 
								Serverless proved highly effective for use cases such as real-time data processing, microservices, and IoT applications, though challenges such as cold start latency, execution limits, and vendor lock-in were also highlighted (Villamizar et al., 2016).
								</p>
								<p>
								I found this unit transformative in reframing my view of cloud computing efficiency. 
								Previously, I associated cloud services mainly with virtual machines or containers that still required infrastructure oversight. 
								Serverless, however, showed me how automation and abstraction drive agility and cost optimization, aligning with broader digital transformation goals. 
								Yet I also learned the importance of balancing benefits with risks, especially avoiding provider dependency by considering open-source frameworks like OpenFaaS or adopting multi-cloud strategies.
								</p>
								<p>
								Practically, I explored how AWS Lambda integrates with API Gateway to create serverless APIs and how Azure Functions supports workflows through Logic Apps. 
								Real-world examples, such as using Lambda for real-time image recognition or Functions for automated enterprise file processing, showed tangible benefits in scalability, cost savings, and reduced time-to-market. 
								These insights provided me with the skills to design, evaluate, and strategically position serverless architectures as part of modern cloud solutions.

								<h3>UNIT 11</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This unit highlighted how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing are increasingly inseparable. 
								Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide the scale needed for AI workloads, while AI enhances cloud services with automation, anomaly detection, and intelligent orchestration (Zhang et al., 2020). 
								Services such as AWS SageMaker, Azure AI, and Google Vertex AI simplify machine learning and analytics, helping organisations adopt AI without extensive expertise.
								</p>
								<p>
								I realised that AI is not just an add-on but a driver of resilient cloud ecosystems. 
								For example, AI can predict demand spikes and scale resources automatically, reducing costs and downtime. 
								At the same time, challenges remain, including model bias, GDPR compliance, and dependence on provider ecosystems, which must be addressed through governance.
								</p>
								<p>
								Practically, I explored how SageMaker supports rapid ML deployment, Azure AI provides pre-built cognitive services, and Google’s BigQuery ML embeds predictive analytics into workflows. 
								Real-world cases such as Netflix’s personalised recommendations and Airbus’s predictive maintenance showed how AI-driven cloud platforms deliver measurable business value.
								</p>
								<p>
								Overall, this unit demonstrated that AI in the cloud is a strategic enabler, combining scalability with intelligence to support innovation, efficiency, and adaptability.

								<h3>UNIT 12</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Cloud computing is no longer a static backbone but a dynamic ecosystem shaped by emerging technologies. 
								This unit highlighted three major forces driving its future: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and Quantum Computing. 
								AI enables predictive analytics, automation, and intelligent resource management, turning infrastructure into a self-optimizing system (Zhang et al., 2020). 
								Blockchain introduces decentralised trust, particularly valuable in supply chain and financial operations where transparency and auditability are critical (Carugati, 2023). 
								Quantum Computing, though still in its infancy, promises disruptive changes in cryptography, optimisation, and large-scale data processing when paired with cloud platforms (Gupta, 2024).
								</p>
								<p>
								What stood out to me was how these innovations converge. AI is already embedded in cloud-native services, 
								blockchain is proving its value in data integrity, and quantum technologies are transitioning from theory to pilot applications. 
								This shifted my perception of the cloud from a mature technology to one that is constantly evolving, requiring continuous awareness from IT leaders.
								</p>
								<p>
								Practical exploration reinforced these insights: AWS Braket enables quantum experiments, Azure integrates blockchain into identity management, 
								and Google Cloud advances both AI and quantum research. Real-world cases, such as Walmart’s blockchain-enabled supply chain and IBM’s hybrid quantum-cloud projects, 
								show that these trends are not just futuristic but active business developments.
								</p>
								<p>
								This unit taught me that future readiness in cloud computing is less about mastering a single tool and more about adopting a forward-looking mindset. 
								By tracking and integrating these disruptive technologies, organisations can maintain competitiveness and build cloud strategies that are adaptable to rapid change.
