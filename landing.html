								<h3>UNIT 10 TASK</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								DR Solution 1 with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour and a Recovery Time
								Objective (RTO) of 8 hours while highlighting the need, for High Availability (HA).
								Definitions.
							</p>
							<p>•RPO (Recovery Point Objective); The longest duration within which data loss, due to an
								event is deemed
								acceptable, is one hour, in this scenario.</p>
							<p>•RTO (Recovery Time Objective); The acceptable timeframe, for systems to be up and run
								again following a
								disaster is, within 8 hours.</p>
							<p>•High Availability (HA); Aims to keep the system running to maximize uptime and reduce
								downtime occurrences
								effectively through failover solutions that cause minimal disruptions.</p>
							<p>Elements of Design.</p>
							<p>Cloud storage, for purposes, with data duplication.</p>
							<p>The instant or almost instant copying of information, from systems to backup systems (in
								the cloud or far away
								locations).</p>
							<p>Make sure that the data stays current, and that any potential incident doesn't result in,
								then an hour’s worth
								of data loss.</p>
							<p>• Balancing the load.</p>
							<p>It spreads network traffic among servers or systems to maintain the applications
								responsiveness in case one
								server fails.</p>
							<p>In systems (HA systems) load balancers play a crucial role, in avoiding service
								disruptions by automatically
								rerouting traffic to functioning systems.</p>
							<p>• Backup Plan.</p>
							<p>Automated switching to the system, in case of a problem being identified in the system.
							</p>
							<p>During an emergency the system seamlessly transitions to an infrastructure such as the
								cloud to ensure
								operations with minimal downtime.</p>
							<p>If there is a breakdown, in the systems operation occurs; it will switch over from the
								location to a secondary
								backup site within an 8 hour RTO automatically.</p>
							<p>• We ensure that data loss is limited to an hour by replicating and storing snapshots in
								the cloud.</p>
							<p>Effective Strategies.</p>
							<p>Make sure to set up storage in locations to safeguard against disasters, in specific
								regions.</p>
							<p>Make sure to implement automated disaster recovery testing to verify that a failure
								occurs as intended.</p>
							<p>DR Solution 2 with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 24 hours and a Recovery Time
								Objective (RTO) of 72
								hours, without the need, for High Availability (HA).</p>
							<p>Here are some explanations.</p>
							<p>In the event of a disaster, it is possible to lose, up to 24 hours’ worth of data.</p>
							<p>Reaching a recovery within 72 hours is essential; this indicates that immediate system
								restoration is not
								necessary.</p>
							<p>Continuous up time is not essential as occasional downtime is acceptable long as the
								system's back up and
								running according to the Recovery Time Objective (RTO).</p>
							<p>Elements of Design.</p>
							<p>•Backup data to the cloud daily.</p>
							<p>Data is stored in the cloud every day using services such as Amazon Storage, Microsoft
								Azure Blob Storage or
								Google Cloud Storage.</p>
							<p>In the event of a disaster scenario arises at any moment, in the future; you can rest
								assured that the backup
								available will not be than 24 hours old, ensuring that important data is still preserved
								up, to date.</p>
							<p>Backup Options Comparison.</p>
							<p>No need for backup systems necessary.</p>
							<p>Cold Backup refers to the process of keeping data and applications in a state until they
								are manually
								recovered following an incident.</p>
							<p>A warm backup is a type of backup that requires some intervention and additional
								configuration to fully
								restore services.</p>
							<p>•Procedure for recovery</p>
							<p>Recovery can occur manually without the need for HA by performing tasks such, as system
								boot up and data
								restoration.</p>
							<p>How It Operates.</p>
							<p>Data is kept in cloud storage away, from the location and in case of any issue it is
								recovered manually using
								the recent backup from that day.</p>
							<p>Noncritical business applications may not require attention allowing for a recovery
								period of, up to 72 hours.</p>
							<p>Key Recommendations.</p>
							<p>For conserving speeding up recovery options for both differential backups.</p>
							<p>Make sure to conduct tests to verify that the backups function properly and that recovery
								protocols are
								established as a measure.</p>
							<p>DR solution 2 with a Recovery Point Objective of 5 minutes and a Recovery Time Objective
								of 1 hour. High
								Availability is necessary for this solution.</p>
							<p>Definitions.</p>
							<p>• With a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 5 minutes there is a limit on the amount of
								data that can be lost
								requiring continuous data replication to ensure minimal loss.</p>
							<p>• If there is an issue it needs to be fixed and up and running again within an hour.</p>
							<p>Ensuring accessibility is crucial, for High Availability (HA) where the system must
								remain operational without
								prolonged downtime.</p>
							<p>Components of Design.</p>
							<p>• Instant Data Duplication.</p>
							<p>Continuous replication of data to a location guarantees that the loss of data is
								minimally capped at 5
								minutes.</p>
							<p>To maintain data integrity, between backup systems synchronous replication is a utilized
								method.
								Backup mechanisms.</p>
							<p>A complete duplicate setup (comprising servers, networks and storage) spread across
								areas.</p>
							<p>Involve active passive groups where both sites can manage traffic (active active) or the
								secondary site is
								ready, as a backup (active passive).</p>
							<p>• Automated system backup, in case of failure.</p>
							<p>An automated system identifies any issues. Promptly switches the service to the backup
								infrastructure ensuring
								minimal to no interruption.</p>
							<p>Failover occurs within a timeframe of seconds, to minute. Ensure that all services are
								fully operational
								before the 1-hour Recovery Time Objective (RTO) expires.</p>
							<p>• Disaster Recovery, as a Service often abbreviated as DRaaS;</p>
							<p>Cloud services provide managed services such as real time replication and failover
								options (, for instance AWS
								Elastic Disaster Recovery and Azure Site Recovery).</p>
							<p>In case the main system encounters issues or malfunctions, the cloud is ready to assume
								control without delay.</p>
							<p>How the process functions.</p>
							<p>In case of a crisis situation arises, live duplication guarantees that 5 minutes of data
								is forfeited, and the
								failover process occurs spontaneously in just a matter of seconds to reduce any downtime
								issues effectively.</p>
							<p>• The entire system is restored within a time frame of than an hour, which makes it
								ideal, for applications,
								to missions.</p>
							<p>Guidelines for Success.</p>
							<p>Use data centers located in parts of the world to reduce the chances of outages happening
								in one region.</p>
							<p>• Conduct routine failover exercises to guarantee the automated systems function
								smoothly.</p>

								<h3>UNIT 11</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In the changing world of technology and cybersecurity efforts, like Security and Risk
								Management are constantly adjusting to face obstacles brought on by trends, like
								artificial intelligence (AI) DevSecOps practices, Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and
								automation. These trends come with their sets of benefits and hurdles that shape the
								direction of Security and Risk Management.

								AI is changing security risk management by automating the identification of threats and
								responses, to them to enhance efficiency and precision levels in the process.However it
								is important to address challenges such as biases in AI and false alarms.To sum up the
								influence of AI on security risk management will primarily be centered around
								strengthening confidence and resilience, in security operations.

								DevSecOps incorporates security into the development process by promoting teamwork,
								between developers and security specialists in order to enhance the delivery of software
								efficiently; however it necessitates changes and resources for training purposes. As an
								increasing number of companies embrace DevSecOps practices; it is anticipated to evolve
								into a methodology, in the realm of cybersecurity.

								ERM adopts a strategy, for handling risks by integrating security measures with business
								goals in mind.Even though it may be challenging to put into practice EPM enhances
								decision making processes by taking into account risks such, as cybersecurity and
								financial vulnerabilities.

								Utilizing automation, in SRMs enhances effectiveness by managing tasks and facilitating
								incident resolution; nevertheless depending too heavily on automation could pose risks
								necessitating a careful equilibrium, between human supervision and automated operations.

								In the coming years and beyond, in the realm of supply chain risk management (SRMs) the
								integration of intelligence (AI) and DevSecOps is anticipated to significantly shape
								practices moving forward as continuous research endeavors aim to tune these
								methodologies to bolster security measures and mitigate risks effectively.
